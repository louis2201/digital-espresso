            <p class="story">At Digital Espresso, we believe that every great idea starts with a good cup of coffee. 
                Founded by a small group of dreamers in 2018, our journey began in a cozy garage with nothing but a coffee machine, a laptop, 
                and a shared vision: to brew inspiration and innovation into every cup.</p>
            <p class="story">More than just a café, Digital Espresso is a creative space where passion meets purpose. 
                We serve handcrafted coffee that fuels not just your day—but your dreams. From freelancers to founders, students 
                to storytellers, our café has become a quiet hub for bold minds and warm conversations.</p>
            <p class="story">What started as a humble dream now thrives as a beloved community brand. 
                And just like your favorite cup of coffee, we keep things strong, simple, and full of heart.</p>
